ORGANISATION OVERVIEW
Name of the business Speedy’s Diner
Location: White River

Business started in 2021 as the founder noticed he was not making enough at his current job as a chef and decided to open his own restaurant with his savings. Which there after it became a success around his area being able to also hire staff and making dishes out of this world.
