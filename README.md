ORGANISATION OVERVIEW
Name of the business Speedy’s Diner
Location: White River
Year established: 2021
Founders: Mr White
Business started in 2021 as the founder noticed he was not making enough at his current job as a chef and decided to open his own restaurant with his savings. Which there after it became a success around his area being able to also hire staff and making dishes out of this world. It was not that hard for the business to gather customers near their area as the founder was already a professional chef it was just a matter of hiring staff such as waitresses and chefs.

The goal is to serve good food to the people and grow as a small business, to reach out to more customers
The target audience is everyone who likes good tasting food


GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE WEBSITE 
A well-structured website builds credibility as I we know just being online as a small business it gains credibility. It shows that you are a formal professional company/business. (Zambas, 2017) A website provides valuable information to the people/public, and it should be able to attract customers just by looking at it.

We want to make a website that comes out the top as best looking and user friendly website for a restaurant
 
We will use key performance indicators to measure how well the website is doing when it comes to its targets and objectives. (Twin, 2025)
